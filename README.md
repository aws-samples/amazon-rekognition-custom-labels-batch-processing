# Serverless computer vision label detection 

The ability to apply custom inferencing in images is a use case that is of advantage in many domains. This ability can help us use computer vision to identify the objects and scenes that are specific to a business need. For example, you can find your logo in social media posts, identify your products on store shelves, classify machine parts in an assembly line, distinguish healthy and infected plants etc. The computer vision capability is often built with deep learning models. It automates extraction, analysis, classification and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. The image data can take many forms, however for this example solution we will focus on png and jpg/ jpeg images only.

In this project, we will reference Amazon Rekognition or Amazon Lookout for Vision to use for a computer vision inferencing capability.  To use it with either service, customers need to create a project, upload a few images and train a model to recognise their custom labels in the provided images. To use custom inferencing, instead of thousands of images, you can upload a small set of training images (typically a few hundred images or less) that are specific to your use case. You can do this by using the easy-to-use console. If your images are already labeled, the Amazon computer vision service (Amazon Rekognition or Amazon Lookout for Vision) can begin training a model in a short time. Once trained, the model can be started to use it for inferencing. It it recommended to stop the model after use to optimise on cost incurred while the model is running.

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI or using the Cloudformation links below. The application can be used for Computer Vision inferencing using Amazon Rekognition or Amazon Lookout for Vision. It includes the following files and folders:

- \functions - Code for the application's Lambda functions to check the presence of messages in a Queue, start or stop a Amazon Rekognition Custom Label Model, Analyse Images using a Custom Label Model.
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

This application creates a serverless Amazon Rekognition Custom Label Detection workflow which runs on a pre-defined schedule (note that the schedule is enabled by default at deployment). It demonstrates the power of Step Functions to orchestrate Lambda functions and other AWS resources to form complex and robust workflows, coupled with event-driven development using Amazon EventBridge.

This application can also be used for creating a serverless image label inferencing pipeline for Amazon Lookout for Vision.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon Simple Queue Service, Step Functions state machines, Lambda functions and an EventBridge rule trigger. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.

Please note that this code is provided as a working sample. However, if you intend to use it in production, it is recommended that you implement production best practices including but not limited to error handling, message visibility settings, timeouts, storage lifecycle rules etc. 

### Usage

#### Prerequisites

1. To deploy the sample application, you will require an AWS account. If you donâ€™t already have an AWS account, create one at <https://aws.amazon.com> by following the on-screen instructions. Your access to the AWS account must have IAM permissions to launch AWS CloudFormation templates that create IAM roles.

2. Please refer [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/gs-introduction.html) for instructions on getting started with Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels. When deploying this application you will need to provide the following two parameters for your Custom Label Project.
   - Amazon Rekognition Model Project ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels project that contains the models you want to use. 
   - Amazon Rekognition Model Project Version ARN: The Amazon Resource Name(ARN) of the model version that you want to use.


#### Deployment

The demo application is deployed as an [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) template.

2. If prompted, login using your AWS account credentials.
3. You should see a screen titled "_Create Stack_" at the "_Specify template_" step. The fields specifying the CloudFormation template are pre-populated. Click the _Next_ button at the bottom of the page.
4. On the "_Specify stack details_" screen you may customize the following parameters of the CloudFormation stack:

   - **Stack Name:** (Default: LabelDetection) This is the name that is used to refer to this stack in CloudFormation once deployed.
   - **RekognitionModelProjectARN:** The Amazon Rekognition Model Project Arn
   - **RekognitionModelProjectVersionARN:** The Amazon Rekognition Model Project Version Arn

   When completed, click _Next_

5. [Configure stack options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html) if desired, then click _Next_.
6. On the review you screen, you must check the boxes for:

   - "_I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources_"
   - "_I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names_"
   - "_I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following capability: CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND_"

   These are required to allow CloudFormation to create a Role to allow access to resources needed by the stack and name the resources in a dynamic way.

7. Click _Create Change Set_
8. On the _Change Set_ screen, click _Execute_ to launch your stack.
   - You may need to wait for the _Execution status_ of the change set to become "_AVAILABLE_" before the "_Execute_" button becomes available.
9. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to launch. Completion is indicated when the "Stack status" is "_CREATE_COMPLETE_".
   - You can monitor the stack creation progress in the "Events" tab.
10. Note the _url_ displayed in the _Outputs_ tab for the stack. This is used to access the application.

#### Accessing the Application

After deployment, the application can be used by configuring the following services.
1. The event that triggers the Step Machine is defaulted to run every 2 hours and is set to "Enabled" at the start. This event can be modified and set to "Disabled" if the use case does not need to trigger the step machine automatically. The default 2 hours run schedule can also be modified as per use case. When modifying the run schedule, a key point to bear in mind will be to check the pricing for Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels - which is currently priced per hour. The step machine is configured to shut down the model after 1 hour by default.
2. The Source S3 bucket should be used as the destination bucket for all the images to be used for inferencing. As the images get processed, they will be deleted from the source bucket.
3. The Final S3 bucket holds the images that have been processed along with the inferenced custom label jsons.


### Removing the application

To remove the application open the AWS CloudFormation Console, click on the name of the project, right-click and select "_Delete Stack_". Your stack will take some time to be deleted. You can track its progress in the "Events" tab. When it is done, the status will change from "_DELETE_IN_PROGRESS_" to "_DELETE_COMPLETE_". It will then disappear from the list. 

**Note:** Please note that the provided configuration will ensure that the Amazon S3 buckets and their contents are retained when removing the application via the AWS Cloudformation console. This is to ensure that no data is accidently lost while removing the application. The buckets can be deleted from the S3 console.
